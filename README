StupidMarkov

BIG FAT NOTE: THIS IS A /REALLY/ STUPID IMPLEMENTATION! It works (for
the most part) for me. I didn't write it to be a complete
implementation, or even a sane one. If you're looking for something
other than a toy, please check the SEE ALSO section for ideas, or
search CPAN for something else. =o)

StupidMarkov is a really simply and really stupid implementaiton of a
Markov chain that I wrote in a fit of insomnia at midnight, after
realizing I'd never understood what a Markov chain was, spending five
minutes reading the Wikipedia entry on it, and then taking ten minutes
to implement it. The output using the above synopsis and this
paragraph results in output like the following:

  "is a fit of insomnia at midnight, after realizing I'd never
  understood what a really stupid implementaiton of insomnia at
  midnight, after realizing I'd never understood what a Markov chain
  that I wrote in a Markov chain that I wrote in a Markov chain that I
  wrote in output like the Wikipedia entry on it, and this paragraph
  results in a Markov chain that I wrote"
